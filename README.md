# MatPlot
a Matlab-like plot library for Visual C++ in Windows

I'm not willing to share the source code for now, but everybody can use the library in the form of binary dll file.
The project contains 3 files now, MatPlot.h, MatPlot.lib and MatPlot.dll. Each of them have 32bit and 64bit versions.

The functions can be used in a Console program as well as ay other Visual C++ program. Read the wiki for a short example of how to use MatPlot.

Have fun.
